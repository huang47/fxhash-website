    description: "This Generative Token is the first GT minted on fxhash.\n\nIt also servers as the actual logo of the platform. It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",
