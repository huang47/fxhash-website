# TODO

*This document describes the FXH Token and DAO, which are not implemented into the platform yet.*


# The DAO

As a community platform, fxhash will have a main DAO which will be tied to the FXH token. 

50% of the platform fees will be sent to the main DAO. By staking FXH tokens on the main DAO, stakers will receive a share of the fees every 7 days.

When staking FXH tokens, they will be moved to a waiting pool. Every 7 days, the DAO will perform 2 tasks:

* distribute the fees it received between all the stakers
* move FXH tokens from the waiting pool to the staking pool

By design, it will take 14 days for staked tokens to return tezos.


## Voting

Proposals can be made on the main DAO by spending 1 FXH token. Having tokens in the staking pool will give voting powers to their owners. Once a proposal is made, it will enter a voting phase. Once a quorum is reached, the fxhash team will be responsible for applying its changes if needed.
